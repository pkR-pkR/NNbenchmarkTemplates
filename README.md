# NNbenchmarkTemplates
A repository with a collection of templates (in R and Rmd+html formats) that test Neural Network packages dedicated to regression (no classification). All templates use the package NNbenchmark.

This is a collective work conducted during GSoC 2019 by:
- Student Akshaj Verma  (templates for the packages from letter A to letter L)
- Student Salsabila Madhi (templates for the packages from letter M to letter Z)
- Mentor Christophe Dutang
- Mentor Patrice Kiener (templates for the packages minpack.lm and nlsr)
- Mentor John Nash (new version of the package nlsr)

Visit: 
- The R directory for the .R files
- The Rmd directory for the .Rmd files and the generated .html files
